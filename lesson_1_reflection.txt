How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows which lines were changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	You can track all your changes.    

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Pros: can control size of commit, so they are meaningful
	Cons: Can forget to commit and lose part of your code.   

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because code related files are usually related and changes affect multiple
    files, while other files like document files do not have relation to other 
    files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can be used to view all commits and info about them. git diff shows
    differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This will ensure the possibility to recover the working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git improve my development skills.
